          <p>Recently, I had made a personal video statement where we had to speak about our hobbies and aims in life. 
            This task was indeed a nerve-wrecking work as I had never spoken in front of camera. 
            Overall, it turned out well and I wish to get better at public speaking as well.

          <p>Managing both of my passion and student life has been challenging so far but 
            engaging myself in a multitasking environment has developed a sense of responsibility
             within myself to work better. I perform musical gigs at Soaltee Hotel Kathmandu and other diner restaurants whenever I have 
            my spare time. </p>

            <p>On the 9th of February, I along with my UI Visual's team organized a UPC session for the high school graduates. 
              This program was solely dedicated for the benefits of engaging in community for the long run. I was the curator of 
              the presentation and it was followed by workshops tasks as a source of learning and enjoyment.
